## Description

AS AN avid reader

I WANT to search for new books to read

SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

This MERN application is made to allow users to log in, search for books, and add them to a list of favorites. By creating this app, I hope to improve my ability to create full stack MERN applications and implements other useful tools such as JS Web Tokens to create an up-to-date and secure experience for users. 

Once complete, the program should operate so that:

GIVEN a book search engine

WHEN I load the search engine

THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button

WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option

THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button

WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button

THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site

WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option

THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up

WHEN the toggle is set to Signup

THEN I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button

WHEN the toggle is set to Login

THEN I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button

WHEN I enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button

THEN my user account is created and I am logged in to the site

WHEN I enter my account’s email address and password and click on the login button

THEN I the modal closes and I am logged in to the site

WHEN I am logged in to the site

THEN the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout

WHEN I am logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button

THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account

WHEN I click on the Save button on a book

THEN that book’s information is saved to my account

WHEN I click on the option to see my saved books

THEN I am presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account

WHEN I click on the Remove button on a book

THEN that book is deleted from my saved books list

WHEN I click on the Logout button

THEN I am logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button

<!-- I began with the framework, deciding to meld the file layout shown in Module 20 with they layout of activity 4 of Module 20's in-class assignments. After some trial and error, the components were set up in a way that satisfied me and I moved on to the styling. I decided to try and avoid using bootstrap in order to lower the amount of dependencies and keep reaction time quick. I styled component by component, beginning with the header and footer before moving on to the About page, Resume page, Contact page, and then Portfolio page before going back and completing the media queries.  -->

## Credits

<!-- The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).The WHEN/THEN section of this README was based off the project assignment Acceptance Criteria. Most influence was taken from Oh Snap of Module 20 and activity 4 of Module 20's in-class assignments. Many features were also translated from my original Professional Portfolio of Challenge 2. Stack Overflow, MDN Web Docs, W3, and Google were critical to our success.  -->



## Contributing

If you make changes, test it locally on a branch before pushing to main. Clone from the github site and make sure to create your own .env file with your own credentials.



## Tests

No tests written were made for this project, but GraphQL is a critical tool in letting you test the program's ability on the back end.
